# Array Traversal, DFS, BFS and Ancient Maze Ruins on Mars

This is a code I used in my BLOG post YouTube video. Blog post located here: https://geneusprogrammer.com/c-sharp/array-traversal-maze-ruins/

I used Jupyter Notebook to work with Python code. However I saved code snippets as .py file so you can open them and use in eny editor.
C# files were created in Visual Studio for Mac. But they will run in any VS editor.
